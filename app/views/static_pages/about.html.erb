<p>
  Scirate is the idea of <a href="http://dabacon.org/">Dave Bacon</a>,
  but the <a href="http://scirate.com/">original implementation </a> has been down
  for some time.
  This implementation of Scirate is due to <a href="http://intractable.ca/bill">Bill Rosgen</a>.
  To contribute to this version of Scirate, please consider visiting
  <a href="http://github.com/rosgen/scirate3">github.com/rosgen/scirate3</a>
  to view the source or to help with the implementation, but note that an active redevelopment 
  is underway at <a href="http://github.com/draftable/scirate3">github.com/draftable/scirate3</a>.
